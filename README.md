In this repo I save my slides as Markdown files to be used as [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/) ([reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)) slides.

This repo contains slides in different folders so I can reuse some assets globally.

See [GitPitch Asset Sharing](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Asset-Sharing)
